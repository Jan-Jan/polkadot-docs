# Multi-signature Accounts Guide

Multiple signature (multisig) accounts serve as an effective method to enhance security or share control over an account. A multisig account is composed of multiple signatory accounts and requires approval from some or all of these signatories to execute a transaction or operation.

## Creating a Multi-signature Account

To learn how to create a multisig account, you can refer to the [How to Create and Use a Multisig Account](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000181826-how-to-create-and-use-a-multisig-account#How-to-create-a-multisig-account){target=\_blank} guide on the Polkadot support page.

It is recommended that multi-signature accounts be tested on TestNet before being used on the main network.

## Multisig Transaction
