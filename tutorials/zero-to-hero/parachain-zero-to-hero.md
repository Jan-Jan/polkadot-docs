# Parachain Zero to Hero

## Introduction

This tutorial starts with a pre-built template and guides you step-by-step through the parachain development, testing, deployment, and maintenance cycle. This tutorial is intended for developers interested in blockchain development.

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

- Compile and run a local parachain node using the Polkadot SDK Parachain Template
- Build a custom pallet from scratch
- Create a unit testing suite for a custom pallet
- Add both custom and Polkadot SDK pallets to a runtime
- Write benchmarking tests and execute the benchmarking tool to calculate extrinsic weights and fees
- Upgrade the runtime of a Polkadot SDK-based blockchain without stopping the network or creating a fork
- Deploy a parachain on a public test network
- Obtain coretime for block production
